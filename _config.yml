  Hi! My name is Surya and I am an incoming Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify. I am also working in the [Chicago Human + AI Lab](https://chicagohai.github.io/). I am excited about making machine learning more robust in the real world and my research interest includes:
  
  - Better Human-AI interaction by developing a better understanding of machine learning models.
  - Scaling machine learning models and practices for hundreds of millions of users in the industry.

  I have four years of software engineering experience at Flipkart where I developed machine learning, backend and front-end systems for ~100 million users.

      description: I completed my Master's with a specialization in Data Science and Engineering. My research projects were advised by Prof. Chenhao Tan in which I worked on the interpretability of transformer networks and Dr. Geena Kim where I studied multi-modal association between images and sounds using Generative Adversarial Networks.
