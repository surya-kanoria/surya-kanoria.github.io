about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  My primary interest lies in scalable Applied Machine Learning. I single-handedly developed the end-to-end data and machine learning pipelines that provides music recommendations to new users. I have also worked extensively to develop a Personalised Review Ranking system for ~100 million users at Flipkart. Additionally, I worked on a context-based spell correction system for e-commerce reviews and intelligent auto-answering bot. I enjoy working on the end to end lifecycle of a Data Science project - from data analysis and feature engineering to model development and tuning.
  In addition, I have spent four years working as a Software Development Engineer at Flipkart where I have primarily worked on the Android, Website and Windows platforms. My most notable contribution was single-handedly developing an open-source library called DUS which allowed mobile application developers to update the source code on their userâ€™s devices on the fly.
  I am currently completing my MS in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science & Engineering at CU Boulder. My research project includes Interpretability of BERT under Dr. Chenhao Tan and generating bird sounds from bird images using Generative Adversarial Network under Dr. Geena Kim. I hope to leverage my previous experience complemented by research experience in Masters to develop scalable Machine Learning systems in the industry.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
